You've entered a lot of text, unfortunately it might not be possible to create your GitHub Issue because of that.

Mac Mouse Fix Feedback Assistant will try to create a GitHub Issue for you anyways once you dismiss this alert. (Might be blocked by your browser as a popup)

If that fails please try following:
1. Copy the content of the 'Console Logs' and 'Crash Reports' fields somewhere else and delete their content. Now the total amount of entered text should be much reduced.
2. Try to create the Issue again. You should end up on github.com and be presented with a text field.
3. Paste the former content of the 'Console Logs' and 'Crash Reports' fields into that text field.
4. Submit the Issue.

Unfortunately it's not possible to provide a better experience right now without paying for cloud storage.

But here's a cute emoji as thanks for your commitment to providing great feedback for Mac Mouse Fix: ðŸ‘»
