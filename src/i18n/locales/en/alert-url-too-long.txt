You've entered a lot of text - that's great! But unfortunately it might not be possible to create your GitHub Issue because of that.

Mac Mouse Fix Feedback Assistant will try to create a GitHub Issue for you anyways once you dismiss this alert. (Might be blocked by your browser as a popup)

If that fails please try one of the following:
1. Send an email instead by clicking "Send Email"
2. Delete some text and then try to create the GitHub Issue again
    - Delete some text.
    - Click "Create new Issue on Github". You should end up on github.com and be presented with a text field.
    - Paste the text you deleted into that field.
    - Submit the Issue.

Unfortunately it's not possible to provide a better experience right now without spending money on cloud storage or something similar.

But here's a cute emoji as a thanks for your commitment to providing great feedback for Mac Mouse Fix üëª :)
