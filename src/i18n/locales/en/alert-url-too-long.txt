You've entered a lot of text - that's great! But unfortunately it's causing trouble creating your GitHub Issue.

---

Mac Mouse Fix Feedback Assistant tried to automatically move some of the text you've entered to pastebin.org, but that failed for some reason.

Alternatively you could try one of the following:
1. Try creating the Issue again, it might work the next time
2. Create a paste at pastebin.org and copy-paste its url into your report to reduce the amount of text
3. Send an email instead by clicking "Send Email"
4. Enter your text on GitHub instead
    - Delete some text from your report
    - Click "Create new Issue on Github". You should end up on github.com and be presented with a text field.
    - Paste the text you deleted into that field.
    - Submit the Issue.

Unfortunately it's not possible to provide a better experience right now without spending money on cloud storage or something similar.

But here's a cute emoji as a thanks for your commitment to providing great feedback for Mac Mouse Fix üëª :)

(Mac Mouse Fix Feedback Assistant will try to create a GitHub Issue for you anyways once you dismiss this alert - which will probably fail. (Might be blocked by your browser as a popup))
